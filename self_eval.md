# Self-Evaluation

- Reflect on your learning and work today. What are you most proud of?
The things I'm most proud of from this lesson is that while creating the squared method I was able to return a string that interpolated the supplied arg, and the return value of the method.
- What is the power of using methods in our applications?
Methods will allow us to complete common tasks with simpler, shorter code, and they will allow us to create customized solutions to problems that will fit any niche.
